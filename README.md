# VTFCmdContext

**VTFCmdContext** is a **batch file** that adds additional options to the Windows context menu, allowing you to **export `.vtf` textures** from source games directly in `.bmp`, `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.tga` formats straight from the context menu!

The main goal of this project is **to simplify** and **speed up** the process of **exporting textures** from `.vtf` files **without the need to launch any additional programs.** This project utilizes **VTFCmd**, created by **Neil Jedrzejewski** and **Ryan Gregg**

## Installation

## Known issues

1. When converting, **the console window appears** for a moment

2. When converting multiple files, **a bunch of console windows appear** for a moment
